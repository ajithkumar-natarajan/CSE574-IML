# Features
- Built a neural network without using any high-level machine learning libraries.
- Implemented batch normalization on the network; Studied the effect of hyperparameteres such as learning rate, number of epochs, number of hidden layers, number of nodes in the hidden layers etc.; The network produced an accuracy of 85%.
- Modeled a CNN using Keras on top of TensorFlow; Implemeted mini-batch gradient descent optimization and dropout regularization; This network gave an accuracy of 92%.
- Built an Auto-Encoder based K-Means clustering model & Gaussian Mixture Model to cluster the condensed representation of the dataset.
